# Hi-Tech-Glasses
Product Purpose: To improve communication between deaf and non-deaf people
In a world where the number of people that are hard of hearing is increasing, Hi-Tech can adapt and provide technology where someone’s disability does not stop them from meeting their full potential.

# Function of Glasses 
  # 1) Camera
There are cameras attached to the rim of each lens which is detected by motion. The left has the ability to capture and analyze lip reading. The camera on the right rim translates the user's own sign language to generate a response back to others. The only drawback with the camera is that one's lips and the user's sign language must be identifiable within the camera's field of vision.
  # 2) Speakers
The speakers will communicate the message from and to others. In the case where it's challenging to recognize lip reading such as voicemails, videos, or while someone is eating, it lowers the translation accuracy. For these circumstances, speakers are found on temples to catch missed or uncertain motions from the camera function. 
  # 2) Lens
Once the camera detects lip reading or sign language, it will transfer the information to the lens. The lens has a holographic layer where it will display a person translating in sign language or text. A gear is also attached to the corner of the rim that will adjust the distance the user will view the message. The holographic function is similar to "Pokemon Go" or "HoloLens" - holographic glasses by Microsoft. Both technologies use stereotypical holograms to create an augmented reality. Holograms are translucent, which means the user's vision won't be blocked. This is how a deaf/mute person will understand others.

# Function of Watch
The glasses are paired with an HT watch (which is an improved smartwatch) for four reasons. 
1) The glasses have too many features to include which would result in bulky glasses. Since it would be uncomfortable and unattractive to wear every day, a watch can provide the physical space to store the battery, memory devices, chips, and some mechanics for the camera, speakers and lens.

2) Technology such as HT glasses is very delicate. When glasses fall, the lens, camera, and speakers can be replaced. However, if the important commands for the glasses are broken, they will become more costly and harder to fix. The watch acts like a “command center” where it is responsible for acquiring, storing, and transferring translations. By keeping the main functions in a watch, it's less likely that the watch would get damaged compared to the glasses.

3) The watch includes a setting that allows customization in accordance with the user’s liking (this function is coded in another file). Some settings include: 
- Display the translated message in sign language or text?
- Language setting: choose a language 
- The level of transparency of the holographic image (opaque-transparent): 0-100%
- The colour of the holographic image: choose a colour
- Speaker levels (quietest-loudest): 0-100%

4) There are speakers on the surface of the wristband to optimize accurate speech recognition and speech translation.
